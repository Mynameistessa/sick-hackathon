"We have two LiDAR sensor products: MRS6000 and TiM. Here are the differences in benefits between them:\n\nMRS6000:\n1. High scanning point density across 24 layers enables reliable detection.\n2. Special mirror technology ensures high scanning field stability.\n3. High resolution (vertical and horizontal) for precise and rapid detection of a large working range.\n4. Measurement data transferred in real-time via the 1-Gbit Ethernet connection.\n5. Compact and rugged design with"
